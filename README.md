# roguelove
Roguelike code written in Lua, based on [Possession](http://possessiongame.com/ "Possession"). Designed to be used with the [LÖVE](http://love2d.org/ "LÖVE") game framework (http://love2d.org)

Currently in a non-playable state with engine code identical to Possession, but I plan on adding more features in the future, including a playable example game.

Available under the MIT license if you want to use any of the code. If you do use it, please let me know! I'd be interested to see what you make with it.

# roguelove
Roguelike code written in Lua, based on [Possession](http://possessiongame.com/ "Possession"). Designed to be used with the [LÖVE](http://love2d.org/ "LÖVE") game framework (http://love2d.org)

Currently not a full game, but has some test content.

Current features being worked on that weren't in Possession:
Items and inventory (pretty much fully implemented, though some interface cleanup is needed and NPCs don't currently use them)
NPC factions (the NPC side of them is basically complete, but player interaction needs to be added)

Available under the MIT license if you want to use any of the code. If you do use it, please let me know! I'd be interested to see what you make with it.
